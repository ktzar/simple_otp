# Simple app that can store a single OTP token

This app is live on [Github Pages](https://ktzar.github.io/simple_otp/). You can use it to store a single TOTP code.

_Pro tip_: Add any string to the URL hash (for example, `https://ktzar.github.io/simple_otp/#google`) to store another token. Remember the hash name or you won't be able to access the token again without using DevTools!
